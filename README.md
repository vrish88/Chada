Chada
=====
A chat application that uses [jslatts's][https://github.com/jslatts] [nodechat-tutorial][https://github.com/jslatts/nodechat-tutorial] as the basis for the project.

Todo
====
1. Reconnect a client to the server if the connection is dropped. It happens right now when the server is restarted (can bypass if the client refreshes their screen)
2. Restyle code snippets
3. Create an API so that automatic messages can be posted an broadcast.
4. Figure out if we need to remove user auth. Perhaps go to a nickname system and have authentication be just a password at the chat level.
5. Multiple chats. Can automatically create a new chat room by going to /what-ever-you-want and it would create a new chat with a title of 'What Ever You Want'.
